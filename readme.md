## Questions and Confusions

* Cached service worker js file. Even though the header for this file doesn't specify cachable, and I added a button to update the service worker, still I don't see my change of service worker in the browser instantly. Why?

* In Chrome's `chrome://inspect/#service-workers` I sometimes see workers appearing twice with the same pid. So different service workers might be sharing the same process under the hood?
